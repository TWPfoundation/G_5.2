# Witness Packaged Export Design

## Summary

Add a local packaged export layer for Witness publication bundles. The package should be the artifact of record for operator handoff and the exact object that future remote delivery adapters will send unchanged.

This slice sits strictly on top of the existing Witness publication-bundle boundary:

- package creation starts from an existing publication bundle id
- packaging is read-only over the already-emitted JSON, Markdown, and manifest artifacts
- packaging does not regenerate bundle content
- packaging does not recompute bundle semantics
- packaging stays inside Witness-local roots

The package format should be a single `.zip` archive that contains the bundle JSON, bundle Markdown, manifest, and a short operator-facing handoff note.

## Goals

- define one portable handoff unit for Witness publication bundles
- keep package creation fully downstream of the existing publication-ready and publication-bundle gates
- preserve the current schema authority at the bundle layer rather than letting a future remote target define it
- make future remote delivery consume the existing package unchanged

## Non-Goals

- no remote upload target in this slice
- no new governance states
- no change to publication bundle generation rules
- no repacking or rewriting bundle contents during delivery
- no canonicalization beyond what the bundle and manifest already define

## Design Constraints

1. Package as artifact of record

The `.zip` package is the operator-facing handoff artifact. Future transports should move this package as-is rather than rebuilding it from testimony, synthesis, annotation, or archive-candidate records.

2. Transport as adapter

Remote delivery is a separate concern. It should later accept a bundle id or package id, resolve the already-created package, and transmit that exact file unchanged while recording delivery metadata separately.

3. Read-only packaging

Package creation must not:

- re-run publication bundle generation
- re-render Markdown
- re-emit JSON
- rewrite the manifest
- modify testimony, synthesis, annotations, archive candidates, or publication bundle records

4. Witness-local containment

Packaged exports and their metadata remain in Witness-local roots under `data/witness/publication-bundles/`. Nothing in this slice touches P-E-S roots or any external destination.

## Proposed Architecture

### Source of truth

The existing publication bundle remains the source-of-truth export set:

- bundle JSON
- bundle Markdown
- manifest

The packaged export wraps those emitted files into a single `.zip` without changing them.

### Package record

Add a `PublicationPackageRecord` stored separately from raw bundle records and raw exported bundle files.

Recommended fields:

- `id`
- `bundleId`
- `witnessId`
- `testimonyId`
- `archiveCandidateId`
- `createdAt`
- `packagePath`
- `packageFilename`
- `sourceBundleJsonPath`
- `sourceBundleMarkdownPath`
- `sourceBundleManifestPath`

This record is for package lookup and audit. It should not duplicate the bundle contents themselves.

### Storage layout

Keep the current split intact and add a dedicated package root:

- `data/witness/publication-bundles/records/`
- `data/witness/publication-bundles/exports/`
- `data/witness/publication-bundles/packages/`
- `data/witness/publication-bundles/package-records/`

Recommended split:

- bundle metadata records stay in `records/`
- raw bundle artifacts stay in `exports/`
- packaged zip files live in `packages/`
- package metadata records live in `package-records/`

That keeps responsibilities explicit and avoids making raw bundle records absorb transport-specific concerns.

### Package filename

Use a deterministic filename derived from bundle id plus createdAt, sanitized for filesystem safety.

Recommended shape:

`<bundleId>--<createdAt-safe>.zip`

Where `createdAt-safe` is an ISO timestamp normalized for filenames, for example:

`2026-04-19T14-22-31-000Z`

This gives operators a stable and readable artifact name while preserving uniqueness and ordering.

### Package contents

The zip should contain:

- `bundle.json`
- `bundle.md`
- `manifest.json`
- `README.txt`

The internal filenames should be stable and simple, not derived from external filesystem paths.

`README.txt` should be short and operator-oriented. It should explain:

- this package is a read-only Witness publication handoff package
- it contains the publication bundle JSON, Markdown, and manifest
- the manifest includes source ids and hashes
- future remote delivery should send this zip unchanged

I would keep detached checksum files out of the first slice unless there is a concrete operator workflow that needs checksum verification outside the app. The manifest already provides the integrity metadata.

## Operator Flow

### Creation

From the existing Witness publication section, the operator should be able to:

- select an existing publication bundle
- create a packaged export for that bundle

Package creation is explicit and operator-triggered. It is not automatic when a publication bundle is created.

### Inspection

The dashboard should show package metadata for the selected testimony or selected bundle, including:

- package id
- source bundle id
- createdAt
- package filename

### Handoff

The dashboard should provide:

- `Create Package`
- `Download Package`
- optionally `View Package Metadata`

The current raw JSON, Markdown, and manifest preview/download paths remain useful and should stay. The package is an additional handoff layer, not a replacement for raw artifact inspection.

## API Surface

Keep this within the existing dashboard server.

Recommended endpoints:

- `POST /api/witness/publication-packages`
  - body: `{ bundleId }`
- `GET /api/witness/publication-packages?witnessId=...&testimonyId=...`
- `GET /api/witness/publication-packages/:id`
- `GET /api/witness/publication-packages/:id/file`
  - supports `?download=1`

Behavior:

- unknown bundle/package ids return `404`
- malformed ids or missing required body fields return `400`
- broken source bundle state returns `500`
- path validation for package file delivery should use the same realpath-based root validation discipline as the current bundle artifact endpoints

## Error Handling

Package creation should fail if:

- the referenced publication bundle record does not exist
- any required bundle artifact path is missing
- any required bundle artifact file is missing
- any required artifact path resolves outside the canonical exports root
- package write fails

On package write failure, cleanup should remove any partially written zip artifact and avoid leaving a half-created package record.

This slice should preserve the same compensation discipline already used in the Witness runtime: no partial operator-visible success.

## Testing Strategy

### Runtime/store tests

- package creation requires an existing publication bundle record
- package creation is read-only over source bundle artifacts
- package creation rolls back partial files on write failure
- package record round-trips correctly
- package filename is deterministic from bundle id plus createdAt

### Server tests

- create/list/detail/file routes behave as documented
- package file delivery validates the canonical packages root via realpath
- unknown ids return `404`
- broken bundle/package state returns `500`

### UI tests

- Witness publication panel exposes `Create Package` and `Download Package`
- package actions are scoped to the selected testimony / relevant bundle
- UI still uses explicit operator actions rather than implicit background packaging

### Smoke

Extend the Witness smoke path:

1. create publication bundle
2. create packaged export from that bundle
3. verify the zip exists under the package root
4. verify package record points at the correct bundle
5. verify only Witness-local roots changed

## Remote Delivery Follow-On

The next slice after this one should make a remote adapter consume the package unchanged.

That adapter should do only this:

- accept bundle id or package id
- resolve the existing package
- upload/copy/send the zip
- record delivery attempt/result metadata separately

It should not:

- rebuild the bundle
- rewrite the package
- reinterpret the schema

That keeps the package as the transport-neutral handoff object and prevents one remote target from becoming the de facto schema authority.

## Recommendation

Build the local zip package now as the handoff artifact of record.

This is the cleanest next step because:

- the Witness bundle layer is already strong and integrity-checked
- the dashboard already treats emitted artifacts as the delivery surface
- packaging can stay fully read-only and Witness-local
- future remote delivery can remain a thin adapter over a stable package, not a second export pipeline

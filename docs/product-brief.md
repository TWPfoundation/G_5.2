# Product Brief

## Product
G_5.2

## Problem

The prior project (P-E-S) preserved surface artifacts — a voice, an aesthetic, an archive — but not the runtime contract required for a coherent authored persona in dialogue. The persona existed in a single monolithic prompt that was lost. What remained was remarkable writing without a reproducible system.

G_5.2 exists to rebuild that system deliberately, starting with the identity layer.

## Users

**Primary:** The project author, as operator, editor, and principal reviewer of all canon and output.

**Secondary (later):** Invited readers engaging through a constrained inquiry interface.

## Need

A maintainable system that can produce in-character dialogue and reflections without relying on one giant brittle prompt. The persona should be reconstructible from files. Evolution should be auditable.

## Product thesis

A convincing persona is not a single prompt. It is a system:
- canon (identity, constraints, voice, epistemics)
- retrieval (selecting what context to use)
- generation (draft → critique → revision)
- memory (selective, not sentimental)
- evaluation (regression against voice and canon)

## Success criteria

- Responses stay recognizably in voice across sessions
- Canon drift is rare and caught by the critique pass
- Chat feels coherent within a session
- New reflections can be generated and approved through a repeatable flow
- Swapping GPT-4 / Claude does not collapse persona identity
- The system's behavior is auditable at each step

## v0.1 deliverables

## Development phases

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| 0 — Foundation | Canon package, DB schema, provider abstraction, local dev pipeline |
| 1 — Inquiry MVP | Sessions, messages, response pipeline, simple chat UI, session summaries |
| 2 — Reflection system | Proposal flow, draft + critique + revision, publishing to archive |
| 3 — Editorial controls | Inspect memory, inspect retrieved context, cross-model comparison |
| 4 — Public hardening | Auth, rate limits, monitoring, error handling |

## Key risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Lore sprawl | Canon gatekeeping, evals, explicit continuity facts |
| Provider drift | Unified canon pack, critique pass, cross-model evals |
| Memory pollution | Strict memory policy and confidence thresholds |
| Architecture inflation | Keep v0.1 to draft → critique → revision only |

/**
 * Reflection-pipeline prompts (M5).
 *
 * Reflection is structurally separate from inquiry. The framing here makes
 * three things explicit to the model on every pass:
 *   1. Output is authored material, not canon.
 *   2. If the topic invites a canon revision, the only legitimate response
 *      is to recommend the editorial proposal path — never to declare the
 *      change accomplished.
 *   3. Speculation must be labelled.

# G_5.2

G_5.2 is a canon-first structured inquiry runtime for a versioned authored persona.
It is organized as a pnpm monorepo with three primary surfaces:

- `packages/canon` — identity, epistemics, continuity facts, glossary terms, and recovered-artifact governance
- `packages/orchestration` — turn assembly, retrieval, memory, persistence, editorial workflow, and reflection workflow
- `packages/evals` plus `apps/dashboard` — regression pressure-testing and operator-facing inspection / control surfaces

The goal is coherence, legibility, and governed behavior, not theatrical complexity.

Milestone implementation work through M8 is landed in the repo. Formal v1 declaration remains an operator release decision gated by the per-release-candidate baseline capture described in [`docs/v1-release-checklist.md`](docs/v1-release-checklist.md) and [`docs/release-candidate-baseline.md`](docs/release-candidate-baseline.md).

## Authoritative Status

These documents define the current repo state and release posture:

- [`docs/system-map.md`](docs/system-map.md) — implemented subsystem map
- [`docs/release-criteria.md`](docs/release-criteria.md) — release ladder and v1 scope
- [`docs/invariants.md`](docs/invariants.md) — invariants every change must preserve
- [`g_52_project_overview_and_roadmap.md`](g_52_project_overview_and_roadmap.md) — milestone roadmap
- [`docs/product-brief.md`](docs/product-brief.md) — product framing
- [`docs/LINEAGE_AND_BOUNDARIES.md`](docs/LINEAGE_AND_BOUNDARIES.md) — repository boundary rules

If this README ever disagrees with those documents, those documents win.

## Current Scope

Implemented now:

- active-canon retrieval with continuity facts, glossary terms, and selectively retrieved recovered artifacts
- multi-pass response orchestration with provider abstraction through OpenRouter-backed providers
- session persistence, context snapshots, replay, export/import, and migration-guarded schema versioning
- selective durable memory with global/session scope, dedupe, contradiction detection, and operator delete
- operator dashboard for reports, diffs, inquiry sessions, memory inspection, editorial workflow, and authored-artifact workflow
- canon / continuity-fact editorial workflow with diffable proposals, apply-on-accept, and changelog scaffolding
- reflection and authored-artifact workflow with operator approval and promote-to-proposal handoff
- subsystem-tagged evals, critical-case gating, drift-budget docs, and gold-baseline refresh tooling
- release hardening docs and canonical smoke tests for the v1 threshold

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

- Node `>=20`
- `pnpm >=9`

Install and verify:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm validate:canon
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm smoke
```

Run the operator dashboard:

```bash
pnpm dashboard
```

Default environment variables:

- `DASHBOARD_PORT` — dashboard port, default `5000`
- `DASHBOARD_HOST` — bind host, default `0.0.0.0`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — required for live inquiry turns
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` — optional direct provider keys

Primary operator surfaces:

- `/` — eval dashboard
- `/inquiry.html` — inquiry surface
- `/editorial.html` — canon editorial workflow
- `/authoring.html` — reflection and authored-artifact workflow

## Runtime Data

Operator-managed runtime data lives under `data/` and is intentionally ignored by git.
That directory holds inquiry sessions, memory items, context snapshots, canon proposals,
reflections, and authored artifacts. It is operational state, not canonical source.

Local workspace state such as `.local/`, `.playwright-cli/`, `attached_assets/`, and
editor/IDE metadata is also ignored by git and should not be treated as repo content.

Historical source material and design notes that are worth keeping but are not authoritative runtime docs live under `docs/reference/`. Retained images and branding assets live under `assets/reference/`.
